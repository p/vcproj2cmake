=== Publishing new versions ===

The following should be done directly prior to
publishing new versions:
- verify [unit ~] tests
- verify proper conversion
- verify that
  Ruby script execution does not trigger warnings ("FILE:LL: warning: ...")
- verify that
  content of generated files
  (CMakeLists.txt, and possibly further files...)
  did not deteriorate
  from old version to current version
  ("diff -uN CMakeLists.txt.previous CMakeLists.txt")
- verify that
  a build within the generated build environment works fine
- verify that
  a conversion re-run doesn't bogusly touch (write) any generated files
  in case their generated content/payload happened to stay the same
  ("find . -mmin +0 -mmin -1")
- verify that
  activity triggered by tools/download_projects_random seems fine
  (i.e., no FAILs - in case of input candidates being valid, that is)
